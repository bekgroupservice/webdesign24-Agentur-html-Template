>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Vegas Pro 10 (32-bit) on Windows (32-bit) - Tested & Working
Vegas Pro 10 (64-bit) on Windows (64-bit) - Tested & Working
Vegas Pro 10 (32-bit) on Windows (64-bit) - Tested & Working
Vegas Pro 10 (32-bit) on Windows (64-bit) - Untested

5) Now install Sony Vegas Pro 11 ( Right click on the installer and select run as administrator)
6) When the installation has finished, close Sony Vegas Pro 11.
7) Copy keygen DI v2.0 in installation directory, by default:
C:\Program Files\Sony\Vegas Pro 11.0
8) Run keygen (Vista/7 users, run  keygen as administrator)
9) In Product Name -> Select:
Sony Vegas Pro 11 (32-bits) if you have Vegas 32-bit
Sony Vegas Pro 11 (64-bits) if you have Vegas 64-bit
10) Now hit the "patch" button, in the new window, select the application's directory:  
C:\Program Files\Sony\Vegas Pro 11.0
then hit the OK button, if the same window appears again, this time select the Shared Plugins folder:
C:\Program Files\Sony\Shared Plug-Ins
then hit the OK button and Wait a few seconds till the process is finished.
11) Don't close the keygen yet.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
NOTE 1: If you want to close the keygen at least copy/paste the serial number and authentification code into notepad, These codes are work in pair!, so make sure to copy the code correctly, serial number for Vegas Pro 11 starts with 1T4 and authentification code has 54 characters, example:

1T4-4S93-YJYB-XGSJ
59BT8KL0G-ZDWJXRNKK-DYGMY4HFT-5Y662CXHV-MW3DJWTE4-DHEE2TFS3

( Don't use this code, probably will not work, the keygen needs to identify the ID of your PC to generate a valid code, remember, when you generate serial number, use the same activation code generated with that serial number  )

NOTE 2: If you go to install. directory, for example:
C:\Program Files\Sony\Shared Plug-Ins\Audio
and you see alot of files with "bak" extension, this means that everything has been patched succesfully.
The same patch generates a backup of the original files, if you don't see any file with "bak" extension, that means that nothing was patched, probably you did something wrong. You will find more files with "bak" extension in the application's directory:
C:\Program Files\Sony\Vegas Pro 11.0
This will help in determining if your patched process was successful.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

11) After the patched process has finished, start Sony Vegas Pro 11 (Vista/7 as adm).
12) Copy the serial number from keygen into Vegas Pro 11 (starts with 1T4)
13) After you passed the serial number form, select "Register from Another Computer" and hit the Next button (twice). You will need to complete a form (Enter Fake Info) .
